a bit useful - a bit useless

distance meassurement tool, using Nokia style LCD screen, HC-SR04 sonar sensor and an arduino. 
meassures from 2 - 300cm with about 3% of difference at standard room temperature and up to 50 HZ.

if you like to put this in an enclosure, you should add a button on the back to add the depth of the enclosure to the meassurement.
